# Scoreboard
## A simple scoreboard for card games

This project is right what it says on the tin: **a scoreboard!**

It consists of a simple webpage that asks the user to set up their game (naming the players), and then keeps track of the scores of each player, and their positions from round to round, according to what the user inputs as the result of each round. After every round, the page produces a simple bar graph that shows the progress of each player towards the set goal of the game.

### Why, though?

This little project started with my sister's birthday, in late January. Since the start of the year, there's been kind of a UNO-mania on our family, and we've been playing almost every night since 2018 started. For my sister's birthday, we planed to have a sort of UNO championship with her friends. In preparation, I decided to make a little web app that would keep track of the scores on my laptop while we played. I also made a quick logo and all.

You can see this prototype, which I made in a bit under two days (during which my Internet died) on the Legacy folder, or by clicking on [this link](https://perpetuareality.github.io/Scoreboard/Legacy/) for a live view.

Anyway, the party passed and we didn't play much UNO, but I still really wanted to polish this app. So here you have it!
